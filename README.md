# Food Truck Order System

## Overview

The Food Truck Order System is a Python application that allows customers to browse a menu, select items to order, specify quantities, and generate a receipt with the total cost of the order. The application is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, enabling customers to quickly place their orders.

## Features

### 1. Menu Selection

- Upon launching the application, customers are greeted with a menu that includes various categories such as snacks, meals, drinks, and desserts.
- Customers can navigate through the menu categories and select items they wish to order.

### 2. Order Placement

- After selecting a menu category and item, customers are prompted to specify the quantity of the selected item.
- Input validation ensures that only valid menu items and quantities are accepted.
- Customers can continue adding items to their order or choose to finalize their order.

### 3. Order Receipt

- Once the customer finalizes their order, a receipt is generated, displaying each ordered item along with its price and quantity.
- The total cost of the order is calculated and displayed at the bottom of the receipt.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `menu.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the menu, select items, specify quantities, and finalize the order.
3. After finalizing the order, review the generated receipt to ensure accuracy.
4. Total cost of the order will be displayed at the end.

## Example

1. Select "Meals" from the menu.
2. Choose "Pizza" from the available meal options.
3. Select "Pepperoni" as the pizza topping and specify the quantity.
4. Add two medium sodas from the "Drinks" category.
